#+STARTUP: showall
#+ATTR_HTML: title="All the Icons"

** Installation

You should be able to install this package in the standard way, add it
to the load path and then calling

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'all-the-icons)
;; or
(use-package all-the-icons)
#+END_SRC

*N.B.* In order for the icons to work you will *need to* install the
Resource Fonts included in this package, they are available in the
[[/fonts][ ~fonts~ ]] directory.

** Usage

The simplest usage for this package is to use the following functions;

+ ~all-the-icons-icon-for-buffer~
+ ~all-the-icons-icon-for-file~
+ ~all-the-icons-icon-for-mode~

Which can be used to get a formatted icon which you can insert into
buffers, /e.g./

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(insert (all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.js"))
;; Inserts a javascript icon
;; #("js-icon" 0 1 (display (raise -0.24) face (:family "alltheicon" :height 1.08 :foreground "#FFD446")))
#+END_SRC

*** Inserting Icons Directly

The above is fine if you want this package to automatically decide on
the icon you want for files and things, however, to insert the icons
directly you will want to use these icons functions;

+ ~all-the-icons-alltheicon~
+ ~all-the-icons-faicon~
+ ~all-the-icons-fileicon~
+ ~all-the-icons-oction~
+ ~all-the-icons-wicon~

You can then call these functions with the icon you want to insert,
/e.g./

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(all-the-icons-octicon "file-binary")  ;; GitHub Octicon for Binary File
(all-the-icons-faicon  "cogs")         ;; FontAwesome icon for cogs
(all-the-icons-wicon   "tornado")      ;; Weather Icon for tornado
#+END_SRC

A list of all the icon names for a font family can be found in the
~data~ directory, or by inspecting the alist variables.

The alist variables are all prefixed with 

+ ~all-the-icons-data/~

For example ~C-h v all-the-icons-data/ <TAB>~ will give a list of all the data
alist you can describe /(and the icon fonts they're associated with)/

*** Inserting icons with properties

Each of the above icon functions can also be given different
properties to slightly adjust the way they're formatted, these are

+ ~:height~ - The height of the icon
+ ~:v-adjust~ - Vertical adjust (/positive is up, negative is down/)
+ ~:face~ - The face to apply to the icon, defaults to ~\'default~

So you would call, for example

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(all-the-icons-wicon "tornado" :face 'all-the-icons-blue)
#+END_SRC

These properties can also be used on the ~all-the-icons-icon-for-file~
and ~all-the-icons-icon-for-mode~ functions as well, /i.e./

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
 (insert (all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.js" :height 2 :face 'all-the-icons-lred))
 ;; Inserts a RED Javascript icon with height 2
 ;; #("js-icon" 0 1 (display (raise -0.24) face (:family "alltheicon" :height 2.0 :foreground "red")))
#+end_src

*** Propertizing icons yourself

However, sometimes when propertizing these icons /(for example if you
were customising your mode line)/ you /may/ sometimes have to know the
font family to add in to override the current font family being used,
/e.g./

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (propertize (all-the-icons-octicon "package")
              'face `(:family ,(all-the-icons-octicon-family) :height 1.2)
              'display '(raise -0.1))
#+END_SRC

*** Debugging/Displaying Icon Sets

Sometimes it can be useful to print out all of the icons in an icon
set to ensure that 

- *(a)* they're the correct icon and 
- *(b)* what icons are available and what name they have.

There is a helper function which will print out all of the icons in an
icon set and they're corresponding id/name.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (all-the-icons-insert-icons-for 'alltheicon)   ;; Prints all the icons for `alltheicon' font set

  (all-the-icons-insert-icons-for 'octicon 10)   ;; Prints all the icons for the `octicon' family
                                                 ;; and makes the icons height 10

  (all-the-icons-insert-icons-for 'faicon 1 0.5) ;; Prints all the icons for the `faicon' family 
                                                 ;; and also waits 0.5s between printing each one
#+END_SRC
